# Prerequesites

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

**Download and install `Visual Studio Code (1.81.0)` or newer** from [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## CMake

**Download and install `CMake 3.24` or higher** from [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/).

## Linux requirements

If you open this framework on Linux, please first run the script `./Scripts/install_dependencies.sh` which will install most necessary dependencies except for VS Code and its extensions.
Note that this script will per default install the Vulkan SDK and graphics drivers on your system. You don't need the Vulkan packages for the OpenGL tasks, feel free to comment out the corresponding lines.


## Open Project

# In VS Code

1. Open the Framework as folder in VS Code.
2. Install the required extensions in VS Code (`ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack`, `slevesque.shader`). The first contains CMake Tools and CMake, as well as C++ extensions including clang-format. The latter is for shader code highlighting.
3. The contained `CMakeLists.txt` will automatically be used by Visual Studio to load the project and the CMake configuration process is started immediately and the CMake output should be visible automatically. If not, please find the CMake Tab on the leftmost bar in VS Code and find the button "Configure All Projects" on the top.
4. Select a kit for cmake on the bottom bar.
5. If you want to switch between `Debug` and `Release` mode, find the drop-down menu left of the kit dropdown, it should say `CMake: [Debug]: Ready` or `CMake: [Release]: Ready`.

# Alternative: Using your default generator

We supplied you with a make.bat file for windows and a makefile for MacOS/Linux. You can double click make.bat or execute `make debug` or `make release` to build with your default cmake generator (for example Visual Studio 2022 or Xcode). Project files can be found in `_project` afterwards. You can edit the files to change the generator for example to Xcode by adding a `-G "Xcode"` to the cmake generation command (first line).

# Project Structure

Shader Code is located in the `assets/shaders/` folder, and the application will try to find any shaders inside this folder. You should edit and add shaders only inside this folder in the root of the project.
Source Code is located in the `src` folder, please implement your tasks there and in the relevant shaders.

# Errors and FAQ

Please follow the instructions of this readme carefully if something does not work.
If everything was done correctly, please look if a new checkout of the Repo in a different location helps.
Sometimes CMake caches can interfere for example. Sometimes project caches can also lead to problems.
Windows path length is a major problem often, it is restricted to 260 characters and you should place the repository into a short path
